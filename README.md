# AdventureWorks Medallion Architecture – Azure Data Engineering Project

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end Azure Data Engineering pipeline built using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold).  
The source data is the AdventureWorks dataset hosted on GitHub. The pipeline ingests, processes, and transforms this data using:

- Azure Data Factory (ADF) – ingestion  
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS) – storage layers  
- Azure Databricks (PySpark) – transformation  
- Azure Synapse Analytics – gold layer modeling & analytics  
- GitHub – version control & documentation  

This project is designed to showcase real‑world data engineering skills suitable for production‑grade pipelines.
